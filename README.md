# CS231

I'm recently I'm following Stanford CS231(2017) Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition, which you can find its video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv). Also, the course [notes](https://cs231n.github.io/) are available.

These are the assignments solved by me, you can take them as a reference.
